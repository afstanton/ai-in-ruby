# ai-in-ruby
Monorepo for https://medium.com/ai-in-ruby

To set this up, do:

git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:afstanton/ai-in-ruby.git

If you cloned this repo without doing that (git clone git@github.com:afstanton/ai-in-ruby.git), you'll need to:

git submodule init
git submodule update

I'll try to make sure this repo is kept up to date so you get the latest version of all the submodules.
